        <h8>/ Semantics /</h8>
        <p>This refers to the meaning of the work. Before you start sketching out ideas, you should come to a foundational understanding of the project and what it means to the client as well as those who will see the work.</p>

      <div class="BottomContent">
        <div class="borderContainer">
          <div class="thickTopBorder"></div>
          <div class="thinTopBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <h8>/ Syntax /</h8>
        <p>Vignelli was obsessed with detail, as should any designer who hopes to be successful. Syntactics refers to the construction of the design, from color choices and shapes to typography and the actual words used.</p>

      <div class="BottomContent">
        <div class="borderContainer">
          <div class="thickTopBorder"></div>
          <div class="thinTopBorder"></div>
        </div>
        <h8>/ Pragmatics /</h8>
        <p>The final design should communicate its purpose and message clearly to the audience. For example, the American Airlines logo, which Vignelli designed in 1967, features an abstract representation of an eagle. Given that eagles are symbol not just of America, but of strenght in flight, it communicates this idea very clearly to those who see the logo.</p>
